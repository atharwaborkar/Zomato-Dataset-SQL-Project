By using the Zomato Dataset I have solved the Real time Business Problems.

**1) What is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato?**

**2) How many days does each customer has visited zomato?**

**3) What was the first product purched by each customer?**

**4) What is the most purchased items in the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customer?**

**5) Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

**6) Which iten was purched first by the customer and after that they become the Member?**

**7) Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

**8) What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

**9) If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier â€” how many points would each customer have?**
